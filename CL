Change List: Looks Good To Me?
1. Gemfile
   Check it out!
   added gem 'better_errors'  
         gem 'binding_of_caller'
   added unless RUBY_PLATFORM=~ /mingw/ to compromise for non-Window user
   tell me if it works...
2. .gitignore
   added Gemfile.lock, so we have to run bundle install each time we pull,
   hopefully not much of an inconvenience
